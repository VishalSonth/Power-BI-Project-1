**Power BI Project | Sales Insights Data Analysis Project **

**1. Problem Statement:**

The computer hardware business, AtliQ Hardware, faces challenges in a rapidly evolving market. To address this, the Sales Director aims to invest in a data analysis project that involves building a real-time sales insights Power BI dashboard.

**2. Data Discovery:**

This phase involves project planning and data discovery. The Sales Director collaborates with the IT Director and the data analytics team to create a plan. The team uses the AIMS grid to define the project's purpose and success criteria. Data discovery entails accessing the sales records stored in the MySQL database managed by the IT team. Power BI will be connected directly to this database for data analysis, without the need for a separate data warehouse or OLAP system.

**3. Data Analysis Using SQL:**

The focus shifts to analyzing the MySQL database owned by the Falcons team, which contains sales transactions, customer data, product details, and market information. After the analysis, the data will be prepared for use in Power BI, where ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data cleaning operations will take place.

**4. Data Cleaning & ETL:**

The MySQL database will be connected to Power BI, where data cleaning and ETL processes will be performed. This involves tasks such as currency normalization and handling invalid values to ensure data readiness.

**5. Build Dashboard:**

The team will perform additional data cleaning and then proceed to build a powerful dashboard that provides sales insights for AtliQ Hardware.

**6. Stakeholders' Feedback:**

The Power BI report (dashboard) is completed, and stakeholders are invited to provide feedback. Feedback can be categorized into two types: 
1) Identifying generated questions or insights, such as noticing declining revenues from Electricsara store clients and exploring ways to increase sales, like offering special discounts.
2) Feedback from the Sales Director, who may request specific improvements, such as adding a pie chart displaying revenues from the top 5 clients.

**7. Publish A Report:**

The report or dashboard can be published to the cloud via the Microsoft Power BI application website. Features like exporting to PDF or PowerPoint, using personal bookmarks, creating interactive presentations with report bookmarks, and database syncing are explained.

**8. Dashboard in Mobile App:**

A mobile view of the Power BI dashboard is created to be accessed through the Power BI mobile application, enabling users to access the latest insights on their mobile phones.

**9. Changes Based On Feedback:**

Based on the received feedback from customers and stakeholders, necessary changes and improvements will be implemented in the Power BI dashboard.
